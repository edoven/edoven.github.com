We all want to be more productive at work.  
But often we only know _our_ way of working, _our_ way or organizing the workday or use the tools we need.

What if there is a better way of working?  
What if our way is not the _best way_?   

We created ProductivityGeeks to inspiring ourselves and other people on how to be more productive at work by showing how different folks get things done.
