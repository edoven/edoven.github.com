ProductivtyGeeks is a collection of interviews to productivity oriented people about their routines, the tools they use and various tips & tricks.

## Why should I read this?

**We all want to be more productive at work.**  
But we often only know _our_ way of working, _our_ way or organizing the workday or to use the tools we need.  
**What if there is a better way of working?**  
What if our way is not the best way?  
ProductivityGeeks aims at inspiring about how to be more productive at work by showing how different people get things done.
