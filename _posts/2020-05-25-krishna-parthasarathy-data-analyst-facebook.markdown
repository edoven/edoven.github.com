### What's your job?
I work as an analyst at Facebook in Singapore with focus on optimization problems and logistics.
I moved to Singapore in 2015 to do my masters in Business Analytics and in the last years I worked as data scientist and data analyst for a few companies including Uber and Zalora (a Rocket Internet e-commerce giant), usually in the consumer side of the business.
In my free time I like watching cricket and doing archery.


### How do you manage your todo list and your tasks?
Before I used to have one single document with all the tasks but it was too disorganized and complex to handle.
Now I use Microsoft One Note with different notebooks.
I have a notebook for daily tasks and one that works like a backlog, for weekly/monthly tasks.
I use one note for every task and I mark them as done by changing the title, e.g. "[DONE] send email to team members".


### How do you manage your work-related projects?
The projects I work on usually involve a lot of different stakeholders.  
I use one shared master Google doc per project with all the information inside, like links, open points, scope of the project, etc.
I organize the links related to the projects by using a folder system in my browser.
For each quarter I have a bookmark folder, like 2020-Q1.
Inside that folder, I have a folder for each project or initiative I'm working on where I keep all the important links.




### What tool(s) do you use to manage your tasks?
One Note at work.
Google Keep for personal notes.
Google calendar.


### Do you have a daily routine when you start working or during the day?
I start the day with a block, usually 30 minutes, for checking emails and getting updates on my projects.
I keep a daily journal (in a single note with one entry per day) for random ideas, updates on projects, etc. At the end of each day I spend no more than 5 minutes reviewing what I put in it and eventually create tasks or do actionable items.

### Do you use any time management technique (e.g. pomodoro technique)?
No, I don't use any particular tool or technique.



### How do you keep track of nice websites/resources?
For reading materials and learning, often related to work, I use One Note.  
For more personal things like recipes and movies I use Google Keep.
I also use bookmarks, split into categories using folders. They are synched across all my devices.



### Do you have a knowledge base or something similar?
No but I use notes a lot.
I have different notebooks (or groups of notes) to categorize my notes, both at work and for personal stuff.


### How often do you check your emails?
I usually check them in the morning when I start working and at the beginning of the afternoon.  
Since I work with stakeholders in different time zones, at the end of the day I usually write emails to sync with those people.
During the day I keep the email tab of my browser closed because I find it very distracting.


### Do you label or categorize emails?
I'm a "0 inbox" type of person, I don't like seeing unread emails in my inbox.  
I use labels and categories a lot, for things like my team, other teams, auto-generated emails, etc.


### What other communication channels do you use? And how do you manage them?
We use Slack, but I tend to use it only in the morning and keep it closed in the afternoon to be more focused. I find Slack very distracting.  
I have different messaging apps for family and friends.


### How do you use your calendar? What kind of things do you put in it (e.g. reminders, etc.)?
I don't use it much for personal things.  
For work, I block time slots for personal things like lunch and sport, so people can't send me invites.  
For recurring tasks I tend to use my planning system, i.e. my notes.


### How do you split your time between morning and afternoon?
Now that I'm working from home I split the day into two big 4-hour chunks:
- one in the morning: usually from 7:30 to 11:30 - mainly for communications and syncing with other teams
- one in the afternoon: usually from 2pm to 6pm - mainly for deep work (less meeting)
I take a 2-3 hour break between the two blocks to have lunch and relax so I don't feel burned out and I can start the afternoon block with more energy.


### Anything related to productivity you'd like to improve on?
I'd like to know more about how different people work, especially how they manage their focused time blocks. 


### Anything else related to productivity people may find useful?
When I work on projects and multiple stakeholders I find there can be a lot of noise in the communication.  
We tend to use different communications channels, like slack, emails, etc. and sometimes it's hard to know what has been said about the project.  
What I personally find useful is to use emails for important updates about projects and slack more for brainstorming and random live discussion.  
With emails, I know that in the morning I can check the emails and get the status of the projects without getting lost on many Slack threads.
