### **What's your job?**
I work as a growth project manager at [https://www.e8growth.com](Electric8), a boutique consultancy firm specialized in growth, product, design and research with HQ in Singapore.



### **How do you manage your todo list or - in general - your tasks?**
Honestly I probably have a lot of room for improvement!  
Hahah joking apart, at the beginning of the week I create a list of the most important task I have to work on.
I block time in my calendar for the most important task I absolutely have to do.  
On a daily basis, firt thing in the morning, I review the todo list and I plan my day.


### **A part from the weekly list of task, do you have a backlog with all your tasks?**
No, but I have a list of ideas split by categories (e.g. side projects, hobbies, work, etc.) and other projects.

### **How do you manage your work-related projects?**
I use Notion and I have a folder for each project I work on.  
In that folder I have different notes, e.g. about ideas, planning and random things I have to remember.

### **How do you manage your personal tasks?**
For personal side project I use the same approach I use for work-related taks: Notion + Google Calendar.  
For personal things like fixing a lightbulb or doing sport I don't use any tool a part from Google Calendar.

### **What tool(s) do you use to manage your tasks?**
Notion for the notes.  
Google calendar.  
Sometimes I use the tasks on Google, for things I want to remember that are neither urgent not important. E.g. articles I have to read that a colleague posted on Slack.


### **Do you have a daily routine when you start working or during the day?**
At the beginning of theday I review my weekly todo list and plan the tasks for the day.  
At the end of the day I check the important tasks I have to do the day after or meeting I have to prepare.


### **Do you use any time management tool? (e.g. pomodoro technique)**
In most of the cases no.  
Rarerly, when I need to do some deep work I put a timer so I know I have to be razor focus with no distractions.


### **How do you keep track of nice websites/resources?**
I'm not very good at this!
Recently I started using bookmarks in my browser but there are a lot of good resources that I will never find again.
Recently I started using notion to keep track of resources for specific areas, e.g. growth, journalism, etc.


### **Do you have a knowledge base or something similar?**
No!

### **How often do you check your emails?**
First thing in the morning and a few times during the day.  
I'm not currently working on client-facing projects that requires email communication.

### **What other communication channels do you use? And how you manage them?**
Slack for team communication.  
Whatsapp for a project I recently worked on. Not a big fan of it.

### ** How do you use your calendar? What kind of things get in it (e.g. reminders, etc.)?**
I mainly use it for meetings, obviously, and to block time slots for specific tasks I have to do.
For personal things, I use reminders for recurrent events like gym classes and for event I have to remember, e.g. concerts, etc.


### **How do you split your time between morning and afternoon?**
First let me say I'm not a morning person!  
Morning = check tasks, emails, internal communications + low priority tasks  
Aftenoon = big slot for important/hard things


### **Anything else related to productivity?**
There are days when I have a lot or work to and I just rush to work on my tasks without much planning.  
It's not a good idea and I really feel I'm more productive if I spend 10-20 minutes planning the rest of the day.

### **Anything you'd like to imporve on related to productivity?**
I really suck at managing my knowledge base, since I just don't have it.  
Any reccomendations?
