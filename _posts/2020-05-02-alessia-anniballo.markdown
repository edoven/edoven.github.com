### **What's your job?**
I work as a growth product manager at [Electric8](https://www.e8growth.com).
Electric8 helps companies in SE Asia find, scale and sustain product-market fit via rapid experimentation using product, growth, design and research skills.  
I joined Electric8 six month ago and I worked on a couple of different projects with a big Telco in Indonesia.  
Among other things, I previously worked as a marketing manager in different startups.  
In my free time I love being outdoor in the nature, reading, doing sport, sewing, dancing and exploring the amazing Singaporean food scene.



### **How do you manage your todo list or - in general - your tasks?**
Honestly I probably have a lot of room for improvement!  
Hahaha joking apart, at the beginning of the week I create a list of the most important tasks I have to work on.
I block time slots in my calendar for the most important tasks I absolutely have to work on.  
On a daily basis, first thing in the morning, I review the todo list and I plan my day.


### **Apart from the weekly list of tasks, do you have a backlog with all your tasks?**
No, but I have a list of ideas split by categories (e.g. side projects, hobbies, work, etc.) and by projects.

### **How do you manage your work-related projects?**
I use [Notion](https://www.notion.so) to organize my notes and I have a folder for each project I work on.  
In that folder I have different notes, e.g. about ideas, planning and random things I have to remember.

### **How do you manage your personal tasks?**
For personal side projects I use the same approach I use for work-related tasks: Notion for notes and Google Calendar for the reminders.  
For personal things like fixing a lightbulb or doing sport I don't use any tool apart from Google Calendar.

### **What tool(s) do you use to manage your tasks?**
Notion for the notes and Google calendar.  
Sometimes I use the tasks on Google, for things I want to remember that are neither urgent nor important, for instance articles I have to read that a colleague posted on Slack.


### **Do you have a daily routine when you start working or during the day?**
At the beginning of the day I review my weekly todo list and plan the tasks for the day.  
At the end of the day I check the important tasks I have to do the day after or meeting I have to prepare.


### **Do you use any time management tool (e.g. pomodoro technique)?**
In most of the cases no.  
Rarely, when I need to do some deep work, I put a timer so I know I have to be razor focused with no distractions.


### **How do you keep track of nice websites/resources?**
I'm not very good at this!
Recently I started using bookmarks in my browser but there are a lot of good resources that I will never find again.
Recently I started using Notion to keep track of resources for specific areas, e.g. growth, journalism, etc.


### **Do you have a knowledge base or something similar?**
No!...but I'd really like to.


### **How often do you check your emails?**
First thing in the morning and a few times during the day.  
I'm not currently working on client-facing projects that requires email communication.


### **Do you label or categorize emails?**
No.


### **What other communication channels do you use? And how do you manage them?**
Slack for team communication, it can be very distractive so I turn it off when I’m doing some deep work
Whatsapp for a project I recently worked on. Not a big fan of it, communication can easily get messy.


### **How do you use your calendar? What kind of things do you put in it (e.g. reminders, etc.)?**
I mainly use it for meetings, obviously, and to block time slots for specific tasks I have to do.
For personal things, I use reminders for recurrent events like gym classes and for event I have to remember, e.g. concerts, etc.


### **How do you split your time between morning and afternoon?**
First let me say I'm not a morning person!  
During the morning I usually check tasks, emails, internal communications, etc. I also work on low priority tasks  
In the afternoon, since I'm more productive, I usually allocate big time slots for important things that require a lot of focus.


### **Anything you'd like to improve on related to productivity?**
I really suck at managing my knowledge base, since I just don't have it.  
Any recommendations?


### **Anything else related to productivity people may find useful?**
A cuple of things:
1. I often find it's not a good idea and I really feel more productive if I spend 10-20 minutes planning the rest of the day.  Usually spending those minutes planning can really improve the amount of work I manage to finish.
2. A small thing: when I do some deep work I tend to close all my browser tabs except from the 1-2 I’m currently using. Again, this is to avoid distractions.
