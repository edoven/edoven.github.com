### What's your job?
I work as a data scientist at Twitter in the SMB ads team in Singapore.  
I mainly solve problems for the marketing and sales teams.  
Before joining Twitter I worked as data scientist for other two companies, taught data science at General Assembly and tried to work at my own startup.  
On my free time I cook a lot, ride the bicycle, take long walks, (try to) dance lindy hop and love to discover weird food.


### How do you manage your todo list and your tasks?
It's still very work in progress.  
Currently, after I've used Trello for a while, I started using Evernote.
I use my personal accounts both for work-related tasks and for personal notes.
I have a notebook for everything related to work and, for the TODO list, I use two notes: one for the daily tasks and one for the full list of tasks (like a backlog).  
My daily todo note looks something like this:  
```
20200511 - monday
[ ] task 3
[x] taks 4
[x] task 5

20200508 - friday
[x] task 1
[x] taks 2
[ ] task 3 --> this uncompleted task gets shifted to the next day
```
I tried the [The Eisenhower Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method), i.e. categorizing the tasks into four categories with combinations of urgent, not urgent, important and not important, but I didn't stick to it.  


### Apart from the weekly list of tasks, do you have a backlog with all your tasks?
More or less, in an Evernote note.


### How do you manage your work-related projects?
I tend to use a Drive folder with some Google docs.   
We also use Jira, mainly to manage requests from stakeholders.    
I don't use notes or other things for specific projects.  
Usually I just add the tasks related to a project in my backlog as normal tasks.  


### How do you manage your personal tasks?
I don't do much planning with my personal time/taks.  
I use notes to remember things like the grocery shop list and I add reminders for things to do to the calendar, like play tennis with friends at 18:30 on monday.


### What tool(s) do you use to manage your tasks?
Evernote and Google calendar.  
I used to use Trello but I find having a single tool to keep notes and todo lists works better for me at the moment.  


### Do you have a daily routine when you start working or during the day?
At the beginning of the day I quickly check Slack and the emails to see if there are important communication.  
After that, I plan my day by adding or removing tasks from my todo list.
At the end of the day I move the unfinished tasks of the day to the next day section in the todo list.


### Do you use any time management tool (e.g. pomodoro technique)?
I use the pomodoro technique but I'm not strict about it.  
I usually have no-distraction sessions that can vary from 25 minutes to 45 minutes then I take a break.  
There are some days or periods when I don't use any time management tool and I just go with the flow. After some days I often realize I'm not very productive and I go back to the pomodoro technique.


### How do you keep track of nice websites/resources?
I tried to use [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/) for bookmarks but I didn't stick to it.  
Now I use bookmarks synched with Firefox but not extensively.  
For movies I use the IMDB watchlist.  
For food recipes, Evernote (one note per recipe with tags).  
For random things I use the notes with some notebook in Evernote.   
I also use [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for flashcards, mainly when I have to study things related to data science. It's an amazing tool and it's open-source!


### Do you have a knowledge base or something similar?
I don't know if I should consider my notes a knowledge base.  
For sure I'm not strict about adding everything there.


### How often do you check your emails?
Before I had some pinned tabs in the browser: email, calendar, etc.  
I find them very distractive so I recently removed all the pinned tabs. These days, I check the emails first thing in the morning and another couple of times during the day.


### Do you label or categorize emails?
I only have one filter for newsletters to put them in a specific folder and remove them from my inbox.


### What other communication channels do you use? And how do you manage them?
At Twitter we mainly use Slack for internal communication.  
For friends and family I use a mix of Whatsapp and Signal.  
I use Slack only on my laptop and I've removed Whatsapp notifications from my smartphone, so I check it when I feel I have to (that's probably more than I'd like to).  
I also removed email notifications from my smartphone.  


### How do you use your calendar? What kind of things do you put in it (e.g. reminders, etc.)?
Apart from the meetings, I have some weekly reminders for things I have to do on a weekly basis (e.g. related to project management).  
I recently started adding time slots for deep work and minor tasks so my mind is more focused and I don't always think about "Am I missing a meeting or anything else?!". So far it's really working!


### How do you split your time between morning and afternoon?
I tend to be more productive in the morning but often I have meetings in the morning so sometimes I end up not doing deep work in the first half of the day.  
My ideal work schedule is:
- do some deep work in the morning
- have lunch
- work on some minor tasks
- some more deep work
- work on minor tasks again late in the afternoon


### Anything related to productivity you'd like to improve on?
I'd like to stick more to the pomodoro technique since I feel very productive when I use it but some weeks I just feel I don't want to use it.  
Plus I can be probably better at organizing resources like links, etc.  
Also I still haven't found a perfect way of organizing work-related projects with many docs and multiple stakeholders.


### Anything else related to productivity people may find useful?
1. I tend to have long periods where I don't drink coffee at all and I feel very productive. When I drink coffee - one after lunch and sometimes one in the morning - I have more energy right after lunch but then I feel drained later in the afternoon. A good combination that works for me is no coffee at all + plenty of sleep + eat well (mainly to avoid carbs coma) + do some light activity during the breaks (walking, do some stairs, etc.)
2. I really envy people who wake up at 5 am, do two hours of yoga and then start working. Honestly I don't know if they really do it or they just say they do it because it's cool. For how my body works, waking up at 5 am it's the way to go to have a very low productivity day.  
3. Of course it's impossible to stay focused all day so I get distracted by social media, hacker news, etc. What I find useful is to allocate some time for those activities. I usually start the morning with 20-30 minutes of checking the news, Twitter, etc. But I know that at the end of that time slot I have to start working, no matter what. Without this small trick, those 20-30 minutes can easily become 60-90 and half of the morning is already gone.
